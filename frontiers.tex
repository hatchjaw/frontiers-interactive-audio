    \section*{Figure captions}

%%% Please be aware that for original research articles we only permit a
%%% combined number of 15 figures and tables, one figure with multiple
%%% subfigures will count as only one figure.
%%% Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript, if so, please
%%% remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate
%%% where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and
%%% logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%% NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front
%%% page header

%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when
%%% submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf
%%% automatically.
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be
%%% avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
