\subsection{Hardware Platforms}\label{subsec:hardware-platforms}

The notion of taking a distributed approach to DSP is reliant on the
identification of a suitable supporting hardware platform.
For a distributed audio application, the ideal computing platform should be
small, inexpensive, plus easily and rapidly programmable; of course, it should
also provide audio and networking capabilities.

Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of small, low-cost, open-source
platforms for embedded development, perhaps best known amongst these being
Arduino\footnote{\url{https://arduino.cc/}}.
Though support for audio is limited via official Arduino models, a number of
audio-specific, Arduino-like systems have been produced, such as various
ESP32 and STM32 models, Daisy Seed (itself an STM32-based board), and the Teensy
family of microcontroller development boards.
Also worthy of consideration is the Bela platform; though not a true
microcontroller (being based on the Beaglebone single-board computer, and
running an operating system) it is a small-footprint audio-focused device
suitable for embedded applications.
Platforms of this kind that also possess networking support may also fall
under the category of \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT) devices.

A comparison of selected devices can be found in
table~\ref{tab:embedded-comparison}.
Bela is significantly more powerful than the microcontroller systems, but it is
commensurately costly.
Daisy Seed is well-appointed with memory (which is important for DSP algorithms
featuring long delay-lines, for example), but does not feature ethernet support.
Teensy4.1, and the selected ESP32 device support networking via their
respective ethernet add-ons, but the latter's CPU is under-powered.
Though lacking in memory, Teensy's processor and low price make it the most
suitable candidate to support a distributed, networked audio implementation.
