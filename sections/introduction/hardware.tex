The notion of taking a distributed approach to DSP is reliant on the
identification of a suitable supporting hardware platform.
For a distributed audio application, the ideal computing platform should be
small, inexpensive, plus easily and rapidly programmable;
of course, it should also provide audio and networking hardware, and, ideally,
well-documented APIs for programming and interacting with this hardware.

Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of small, low-cost, open-source
platforms for embedded development, perhaps best known amongst these being
Arduino\footnote{\url{https://arduino.cc/}}, which, with it's networking support, may be
considered a range of \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT) devices.
Though support for audio is limited via official Arduino models, a number of
audio-specific, Arduino-like systems have been produced, such as various
ESP32 and STM32 models, Daisy Seed (itself an STM32-based board), and the Teensy
family of microcontroller development boards.
Also worthy of consideration is the Bela platform; though not a true
microcontroller (being based on the Beaglebone single-board computer, and
running an operating system) it is a small-footprint audio-focused device
suitable for embedded applications.

A wealth of hardware add-ons (e.g.\ audio and ethernet boards, sensors,
microphones, etc.) and open source software libraries exist for Arduino- and
Beaglebone-based systems.
Facilitating audio development, many such platforms are programmable with
Faust, a domain-specific programming language for audio synthesis and signal
processing\footnote{\url{https://faust.grame.fr/}}.
Faust provides \textit{architectures} for a number of embedded platforms via its
\texttt{faust2[...]} tools\footnote{
    \url{https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/tools/}
}, enabling users to write high level DSP code and compile it to meet the
requirements of the audio API on the target device~\citep{michon_real_2019,
    michon_embedded_2020}.


A comparison of selected devices can be found in
\tabref{tab:embedded-comparison}.
Bela is significantly more powerful than the microcontroller systems, but it is
commensurately costly.
Daisy Seed is well-appointed with memory (which is important for DSP algorithms
featuring long delay-lines, for example), but does not feature ethernet support.
Teensy4.1, and the selected ESP32 device support networking via their
respective ethernet add-ons, but the latter's CPU is under-powered.
Though lacking in memory, Teensy's processor and low price make it the most
suitable candidate to support a distributed, networked audio implementation.
