\subsection{Networked Audio}\label{subsec:networked-audio}

The transmission of audio data has been a topic of research interest since the
earliest days of computer networking as it is recognised today, i.e.\ over
packet-switched networks, whereby data to be transmitted is grouped into
packets \textemdash{} or ``datagrams'' \textemdash{} each consisting of a header
and a payload.
Voice transmission over ARPANET was being conducted as early as
1974~\citep{schulzrinne_voice_1992} and the first standard for voice
communication over packet-switched networks \textemdash{} the Network Voice
Protocol (NVP) \textemdash{} was released in
1977~\citep{cohen_specifications_1977}.

With its references to `calling' and `ringing', it is clear that the NVP
standard was intended for digital telephony.
Indeed, research on networked audio was primarily concerned with telephony well
into the 1990s, focusing on real-time voice communication over wide area
networks (WAN) with efforts centring on \textit{quality of service} (QoS),
particularly with regard to the perennial issues of latency, packet loss, and
network jitter \textemdash{} inconsistencies in the rate of packet
transmission~\citep{hardman_reliable_1995,hardman_successful_1998}.
Work at this time dealt with streams of compressed audio data, and speech
coding algorithms to overcome the deleterious effects of dropped packets over
unreliable network paths and low-bandwidth connections.

Whereas the priority for digital telephony, and later voice over IP (VoIP)
systems, is intelligibility, for musical purposes fidelity, and the use of
uncompressed audio signals, is of greater concern.
With the increasing availability of high-speed internet connections in the late
1990s came research into transmitting uncompressed audio data over the
internet~\citep{chafe_simplified_2000,xu_real-time_2000}.
Work of this sort was spearheaded by the \textit{SoundWIRE} project, developed
by researchers at McGill University and Stanford University, and took the form
of a wide variety of experiments with high quality audio over both WAN and local
area networks (LAN).
These experiments included LAN-based real-time musical
performances~\citep{chafe_simplified_2000}, concert streaming over
WAN~\citep{xu_real-time_2000,chafe_simplified_2000}, and sonification of QoS via
a distributed digital waveguide dubbed the
\textit{Network Harp}~\citep{chafe_simplified_2000,chafe_physical_2002}

\subsubsection{Protocols and Systems}\label{subsubsec:protocols-systems}

VoIP research in the 1990s focused audio codecs and data
compression~\citep{turletti_inria_1995,hardman_successful_1998}, seeking a
compromise with the \textit{best-effort} nature of internet service.
The SoundWIRE project, in search of high audio quality, turned its attention
directly to the basic transport layer protocols of the Internet Protocol suite:
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
Chafe et al.\ characterised their compression-free system as taking a
``simplified approach'' to networked audio~\citep{chafe_simplified_2000},
emphasising the importance of delivering multichannel audio of at least CD
quality (16-bit, \qty{44.1}{\kHz}) with as little latency as possible.

SoundWIRE experiments included using TCP for unidirectional transmission such as
concert streaming.
TCP is in fact a bidirectional protocol, but its \textit{connection-oriented},
one-to-one design allows for packet flow control mechanisms that guarantee
packet ordering and provide protections against packet
loss~\citep{schiavoni_alternatives_2013,al-dhief_performance_2018}.
These mechanisms mean that, at the expense of increased latency, quality of
service, and thus audio fidelity, is ensured; ideal for a remote concert
scenario.
%The strict one-to-one nature of TCP clearly places limits on its
%applicability to distributed computing, however.

UDP by comparison is a \textit{connectionless} protocol, providing no guarantees
regarding the integrity of the packet stream, but equally none of the
computational or temporal overhead that such guarantees introduce.
A networked device can send UDP packets to an address irrespective of the
presence or otherwise of another device at that address.
Further, \textit{many-to-many} (multicast) and \textit{one-to-many} (broadcast)
modes of transmission are possible via address spaces reserved as part of the
internet protocol standard~\citep{meyer_iana_2010}.
Via UDP, SoundWIRE was able to run as a distributed digital waveguide over a
WAN spanning around \qty{4500}{\km}~\citep{chafe_simplified_2000}.

From the SoundWIRE project emerged
\textit{JackTrip}~\citep{caceres_jacktrip_2010,caceras_jacktripsoundwire_2010},
a hybrid system that couples a TCP handshake with audio transmission over UDP,
thus sidestepping the overhead of TCP packet flow control.
Rather than relying on TCP's built-in mechanisms for stream integrity, JackTrip
supplements UDP with a number of optional buffering strategies that aim to
tailor its use to operation over local versus wide area networks.
In this sense it is more flexible than TCP, but in effect JackTrip moulds UDP
transmission into something akin to the connection-oriented model of TCP, and,
in its `hub server' mode, into a kind of \textit{multiple one-to-one} design
\textemdash{} multicast transmission is not possible.

UDP has emerged as the protocol of choice for platforms enabling remote musical
collaboration, serving as the basis for NetJACK~\citep{carot_netjack_2009}, part
of the JACK Audio Connection Kit (a cross-platform audio host),
Jamulus~\citep{fischer_case_2015}, Soundjack~\citep{renaud_networked_2012}, and
other jamming-focused platforms, plus more recent entrants, the closed-source,
but ultimately UDP-based Elk OS~\citep{turchet_elk_2021} for instance.
UDP even plays a fundamental role in proprietary systems such as Dante (Digital
Audio Network Through Ethernet)~\citep{dante_what_2022}.

\subsubsection{AoE in the Audio Industry}

In parallel with the work being carried out in academia on SoundWIRE, JackTrip
and NetJACK, audio industry bodies \textemdash{} the IEEE (Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and AES (Audio Engineering Society)
standards groups, and companies like Audinate, the creators of Dante
\textemdash{} were taking an interest in networked audio.
Traditional large-scale audio systems such as those used in broadcast, concert
venues and recording studios rely on the installation of unwieldy systems of
analogue hardware and cabling, with many potential points of failure.
Seeking literally to lighten the load posed by ``hundreds of
kilograms''~\citep{bakker_introduction_2014} of analogue cabling in analogue
audio installations, in the 2000s audio companies were looking to high speed
ethernet as a means to simplify the provision of high-quality, multichannel
audio in industry settings.

Dante, with its promise of low-latency, highly-multichannel audio over ethernet,
and device synchronisation via Precision Time Protocol (PTP), has become the de
facto standard in this area~\citep{bakker_introduction_2014}.
In 2011, IEEE released the Audio Video Bridging (AVB, IEEE 802.1)
standard~\citep{ieee_ieee_2011}, and AES67 followed in
2013~\citep{hildebrand_aes67-2013_2014};
these open technical standards describe operation at layers below TCP and UDP
in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, and provide frameworks for
interoperability between AoE and AoIP systems, including mechanisms for device
discovery and synchronisation, again via PTP\@.
Being standards, and not implementations in themselves, it is then up to
manufacturers to implement the appropriate recommendations in their products.
(AES67, for example, has in fact been implemented in Dante.)

Bakker et al.\ refer to Dante as an ``open'' system, which is true, perhaps, in
the sense that companies can incorporate the Dante system into their products
under licence from Audinate;
from the perspective of the academic community, however, Dante is very much a
closed-source initiative and not a suitable platform for research.
Open implementations of AVB and AES67 could be of interest, however their
reliance on PTP, support for which is not offered by ubiquitous, low-cost
networking equipment, raises the barrier to entry to systems based on these
standards.
Ultimately, if an accessible solution is sought, attention must be turned back
to the transport layer, and UDP\@.
