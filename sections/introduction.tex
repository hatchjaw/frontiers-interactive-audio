\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Spatial and immersive audio techniques have been the beneficiaries of
significant research interest over the past few decades.
Recent developments in virtual and augmented reality technologies and
\textit{object-based} audio have led to an acceleration in interest in the
creation of virtual sound fields via approaches such as Wave Field Synthesis
(WFS) and Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA)~\citep{berkhout_acoustic_1993,
    ahrens_theory_2008,daniel_further_2003,frank_producing_2015}.
These techniques call for the deployment of large numbers of loudspeakers, and
centralised, \textit{in situ} installations of dedicated hardware and software.
The costs associated with such installations have seen them largely restricted
to the preserve of concert venues, cinemas, and institutions with the means to
purchase and operate large-scale systems of this sort.

Advancements in embedded computing mean that there now exist an assortment of
small, low-cost devices with support for audio digital signal processing (DSP).
These devices are open source, relatively easy to program, and may provide
support for communication over ubiquitous computer networking equipment and
protocols.
A network of such devices could be used to \textit{distribute} the problem of
audio spatialisation, potentially lowering the barrier to entry to what is
otherwise a comparatively exclusive branch of audio research.

In this article \textemdash{} which is adapted from a master's thesis written by
the corresponding author, and builds on previous work on a microcontroller-based
networked audio client~\citep{rushton_microcontroller-based_2023} \textemdash{}
we describe the development of a distributed system for spatial and immersive
audio.

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{subsec:research-questions}

The primary focus of this thesis is an exploration of employing a
network of hardware modules to act as a co-ordinated networked-audio system
with a view to supporting a distributed approach to audio spatialisation
techniques.
It is hoped that in selecting a low-cost hardware platform, using ubiquitous
computer networking technologies, and keeping the overall design as simple as
possible, the work here could lead to a lowering of the barrier to entry of
the creation of large scale spatial and immersive audio installations.
The first research question, then, is:

\begin{researchq}
    \label{rq:rq1}
    How can a network of microcontrollers be used to create a distributed
    audio system suitable for managing scalable installations for spatial
    and immersive audio?
\end{researchq}

\noindent
Adjacent to the bare bones of implementation is the performance of the devised
system:

\begin{researchq}
    \label{rq:rq2}
    How can such a system be created and configured such that it maintains
    inter-client synchronicity? What are the effects of loss of
    synchronicity on distributed spatialisation algorithms?
\end{researchq}

% \noindent
% These questions will be our guides in the chapters to follow.

\subsubsection{Prior Work}

Before beginning work on this project, a distributed WFS system was
developed, based on the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and JackTrip protocol.
This consisted of an audio application running on a general purpose computer,
delivering audio over JackTrip to a collection of hardware modules, and
WFS control data over multicast UDP.
Strategies were developed for mitigating the effects of jitter and clock drift,
and these serve as the basis for work on the project described in this thesis.

The prior system was not formally evaluated, but, anecdotally, provided
support for the holophonic effect of primary-source WFS.
These strategies were initial efforts, based on a limited understanding
of the problem-space, and called for further development.
It was deemed, also, that the implementation was constrained by the more
opinionated aspects of the JackTrip system.
